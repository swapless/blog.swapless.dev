## About Me

Welcome to my blog, where I document my deep dives into topics that spark my curiosity or challenge my understanding—be it at the code level or in the abstract realm of philosophy.  

Hi, I’m swapless —a passionate Site Reliability Engineer with 3 years of experience and a budding fascination for performance engineering. ~~I thrive on enhancing system observability, enabling data-driven insights that drive meaningful performance improvements~~ I want to make things go fast. Lately, I’ve been diving into the nuances of emulation performance tuning on handheld computing devices, combining my love for optimization with my need for smoother emulation. 

I'm a firm believer in the [UNIX philosophy](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html)—"Write programs that do one thing and do it well." I strive to reflect this principle in my programming style(even when architectting new systems).

Outside of tech, I cycle a lot to satisfy my need for solitude and have recently taken up learning the violin as a non-tech hobby(I can now understand Suzuki book memes). I also enjoy cooking (of the late night variety). 

Through this blog, I hope to share my explorations, struggles, and discoveries, and perhaps connect with like-minded thinkers along the way.  

Here are some things I [recommend]({{< relref "recommendations" >}}).
