# Recommendations

Maybe I will remember to check back on this list after 30 years and find things that I forgot about. Things which occupied a significant portion of my bildungsroman.

## 🎵 Music

- **Album**: _AM_ by Arctic Monkeys
  - Favorite track: _Four Out of Five_.
- **Instrumental**: _Joe Hisaishi_ soundtracks—perfect for focus.

## 📚 Books

Books that have left a mark on my tech journey and personal growth:

- **Tech**: _The Art of Unix Programming_ by Eric S. Raymond
  - A classic for anyone interested in the UNIX philosophy.
